# Bike-sharing-visualisation
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
This includes:

Trip duration: duration_sec, end_time
Station info: start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude
Member info : bike_id, user_type, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip
My interest exploration
Since the data is about the trips the riders made,we are going to explore how the duration of the trip was affected by the other factors.
I am interested in the the features that best predict average bike trip. These are age, gender and user type.
